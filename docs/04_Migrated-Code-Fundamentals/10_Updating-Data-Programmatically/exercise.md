### Updating Data Programmatically
1.	In "ShowOrderDetails", place a button on the form, which when clicked, sets the "Discount" to 10% (0.1). Name it "Set 10% Discount"
2.	Set the property AllowFocusWithoutBoundColumn=True (This means that unlike Magic, you can park on the button without binding it to a local column)
3.	Replace the message of the "Total" button with a message of a calculation of unitPrice*Quantity and the discount.
4.	Build and test.
