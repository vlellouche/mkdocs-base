### Input Parameters

1.	Create a new UIController named “ShowOrderDetails” in the training folder.
```diff
public class ShowOrderDetails : UIControllerBase
{
+    public readonly Models.OrderDetails OrderDetails = new Models.OrderDetails();

    public ShowOrderDetails()
    {
+        From = OrderDetails;                        
    }
```
2.	Build and put the following columns on a grid:
![ShowOrderDetails](Show_Order_Details.png)

3.	In "ShowOrders", place a button at the bottom of the screen and set its Text to “Details”.
4.	Double click on the button and call to the “ShowOrderDetails” in the controller 
```diff
private void button2_Click(object sender, ButtonClickEventArgs e)
{
+            new ShowOrderDetails().Run();
}
```
5.	Build and run.
6.	As you can see, there is no "where" criteria and all the orders are displayed.
7.	To add a criteria based on the orderID, go to the Run method in "ShowOrderDetails" and add the following parameter with a Where.Add line of code inside the Run method to filter the data according to the input parameters.
```diff
- public void Run()
+ public void Run(Number orderId)

{
+   Where.Add(OrderDetails.OrderID.IsEqualTo(orderId));
    Execute();
}
```

8.	The `Where.Add` can be written inside the Run method, as long as it’s before the calling to the `Execute` method.
9.	In “ShowOrders” designer, add the `orderId` from the controller. 
```diff
private void button2_Click(object sender, ButtonClickEventArgs e)
        {
-            new ShowOrderDetails().Run();
+            new ShowOrderDetails().Run(_controller.Orders.OrderID);
        }
```

10. Build and run. 
11. Call to “ShowOrderDetails” from different rows and see that the data in the second screen matches the values of the current row in the calling screen.
