### SQLGroupBy
1.	Create a UIController that displays a list of “Products” from the entity, where the sum of the "OrdersValue" from the "OrderDetails" entity is more than 1000 (Use the ENV.Data.SQLGroupBy class).
2.	Show the number of rows from the "OrderDetails" table and the sum value next to each “Product”.
3.	Add a join relation to the "Categories" table and show the "CategoryName" in the list.
4.	Build and test.
