### KeepViewVisibleAfterExit
1.	`KeepViewVisibleAfterExit` is a property of the controller that allows us to keep the View (Form) of the controller visible even after we exit the screen. It was mainly used to keep a child windows visible long time ago before the subform control was introduced. 
(same to the "Close Task Window = No" task property in Magic)
2.	For future development, it is recommended to use the subform control. However, understanding this topic is important for maintaining existing code.
