## Handlers and Commands
1.	In this section we will cover how the migrated code handles Magic events and handlers.

### 7.3.1	Handler types
1.	There are three types of Handlers:
    a.	**Keyboard** (System in Magic)
    b.	**Internal Commands** (Internal in Magic)
    c.	**Custom Commands** (User in Magic)
    
Handlers are declared in the constructor using `Handlers.Add()`
