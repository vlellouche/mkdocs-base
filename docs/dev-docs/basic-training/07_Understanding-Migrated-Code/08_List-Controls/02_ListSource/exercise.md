### List Controls – ListSource
1.	In “ListControlsDemo”, replace the "ReportsTo" textbox with a combo box control that will be connected to the "ReportsTo" column.
2.	The combo box list source should be based on the "Employees" table and will display the "FirstName" column from that table.
3.	Filter the combo box list to show all the employees except the current employee.
4.	Sort the list in alphabetical order.
5.	Build and test. Make sure that when you select an item in the ComboBox the data is saved to the database.

### List Controls - Summary
1.	Create a new UIController named “ListControlsSummary” that will display an upper grid with a list of "Orders" and a lower tab control with 2 tabs:
    a.	Customer Details – Display details of the current order customer
    b.	Employee Details – Display details of the current order employee
2.	Build and run.
