### Namespaces and class
1.	In C# we write code only inside classes.
2.	In general, each class is saved to its own file.
3.	Namespaces are used to organize the classes, just like folders are used to organize files.
4.	A namespace can contain other namespaces.
5.	In general, each namespace is a folder, containing class files.
